Hello, my name is Guillaume Van Putten, I am a 5th year student at the French school ESILV. I am currently an exchange student in Riga Technical University, in the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication.
This website is a project for the course Computer Technologies in Telecommunciation. It&rsquo;s a kind of CV where I share my professional experiences and the projects I could take part in.

<div class=post-content><p>DeVinci Fablab and DaVinciBot are two associations that cohabit in the Fablab space located on the 5th floor of the Learning Center at the Pôle Léonard de Vinci. DeVinci Fablab is an association of makers who are there to help students in their personal and professional projects while managing the 3D printing park. DaVinciBot is a robotics association which is represented by two projects that progress from year to year, namely the humanoid robot InMoov and the Robotics Cup. In addition to their individual progress, these two associations also have a common objective which is to make live the Fablab space in which they meet and help any person who would come to see them. This is how the idea of a collaborative project, named Compagnon Espace Fablab, was born.</p>
<p>Our first objective is to create an interactive robot that allows visitors to get information about the equipment, the 3D printing system, the projects in progress while animating the Fablab space. The goal of this project is to integrate many new technologies such as Lifi, Leap Motion, Mapping, autonomous movement and many others to develop new areas of knowledge.</p>
<p>Our project team is composed of two teams, the Robot team with Séfana, Léo, Baptiste, Alix and Guillaume and the HMI team with Sylwia, Solène, Quentin, Emma and Victor.</p>
<p>The different stakeholders are our customers, the Devinci FabLab and DaVinci Bot, our users are the members of these associations as well as the visitors of the FabLab space.</p>
<p>The robot team was in charge of the creation of a rolling base, the implementation of an electronic system, the servoing of motors and the detection of obstacles via mapping. The HMI team was in charge of designing a voice assistant capable of answering visitors' questions as well as a reception station capable of recognizing people by their first name.</p>
<p>As the project is very popular, there are already many other ideas of development and improvement for the future years as the development of interactive games with the robot (hide-and-seek, interactive questions&mldr;), recognition of emotions, the use of the robot to remind members of the events taking place in the Fablab, creation of other robots, an application that allows to direct all these small machines and many others&mldr;</p>
