At the end of high school, I chose ESILV to continue my studies in the field of engineering, a generalist school focused on digital. I spent 3 years seeing courses on very diverse subjects, like mechanics, mathematics, computer science or electricity. In the 4th year I chose the IoT and Security major, wanting to orient my skills around embedded systems.
