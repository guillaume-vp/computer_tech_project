As part of my engineering course, I had to do an academic exchange abroad, after several complications related to the health situation around Covid-19, I was finally accepted for a semester in Riga in the Riga Technical University. In this school I chose the Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunication in order to increase my skills and knowledge in the field of embedded systems. For this exchange programm, I am taking courses on web development, FPGA, electronic design, cryptology and wireless communication.
