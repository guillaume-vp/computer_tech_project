Thanks to complétude, a service that connects tutors with children or students in academic difficulty, I was able to take care of middle and high school students. I taught math, physics and chemistry, which requires patience and listening skills, but I really enjoyed helping these students and helped them improve their grades, but most importantly I think I taught them better work methods.
