I did this internship at BLET Measurement Group, a metrology company that resells measuring instruments and offers calibration services. Researching and understanding new products is essential to remain competitive in this market. In addition, the company is constantly improving its calibration laboratory to be able to respond to all types of requests. 

 

In this context, associated with another intern and under the supervision of Thibaut Champenois, the CTO of the company, the missions I was entrusted with during this internship were in the field of research and development, with 3 main subjects  

 

- The handling of a professional software allowing the centralization of the technical data and the calculations of physical measurements 

 

This mission allowed us to discover some of the calibration devices present in the laboratory and to study the way in which they communicate their data, and once connected to a computer, to recover these data in the business software. 

We were able to completely connect 4 machines to the software. 

 

- The development of a measurement application allowing the automation and the communication of a sensor 

 

In order to win a contract, we were asked to create an application for a laser profilometer for train wheels, replacing the manufacturer's application and more adapted to our customer. 

We understood the mode of communication, the language used and the processing to be done to retrieve the data of interest to us, to end up with a functional Android application. 

 

- The creation of a system to calibrate threaded rods with a laser scanning micrometer 

 

Combining a linear rail with a laser scanning micrometer that takes many points along the length of the threaded rod provides a computer profile of the rod. The necessary data is then obtained through various calculations and measurements. 

Creation of a Windows application to accompany the measurement procedure and the calculation of values for the calibration of the threaded rod. 

 

This internship allowed me to discover the world of metrology, the difficulty to adapt to each manufacturer and the problems of precision of the devices. It was a good experience that allowed me to use and develop knowledge and skills, both technical and human, developed during my course at ESILV.
