As part of the ESILV's teaching programme, we must complete an internship of at least 12 weeks, there are no restrictions for this internship, the aim is to acquire experience in a company, whether technical or relational. For my part, I did this internship in the company Marin d'eau douce, a start-up company that rents boats without licence for small groups, located in the pound of La Villette in the 19th district of Paris.

I was therefore in an outdoor touristic environment in contact with customers from France and elsewhere, as part of a team of about fifteen people in charge of ensuring bookings from 9am to 10pm for a total of 37 boats. 
The missions of this course are varied, all that can be done in the base is a potential mission: manage the reception or the bar, bring and clean the boats, explain safety rules and boat handling, get customers on board, repair the boats, answer the phone, refuel the fridge, remove algae that obstruct boat traffic, cancel deposits, supervise the boats, empty the bins, organize boat distribution, check autonomy, answer customers' questions, manage reservation planning, put the boats in their place...

To do this, it is necessary to organize in the team to share the most important tasks in each situation for the proper functioning of the base, plan ahead the day and potential problems to find appropriate solutions.
There are two difficult criteria to predict that can cause problems, the proper functioning of boats and the seriousness and punctuality of customers. This is particularly problematic on days when the schedule is full, most often on weekends with good weather, because the booking slots follow each other without dead time. This means that a delay in the return of a customer or a problem on a boat that forces us to stop it can lead to a chain of delays that can sometimes be impossible to catch up on. Although we try to have a few backup boats, sometimes that's not enough. In these situations, we must pay attention to customer satisfaction by offering them various advantages to apologize for the delay. Customer satisfaction is essential because Marin d'eau douce pays great attention to its reputation on the various rating sites (tripadvisor, google), it is one of the most important means to increase the number of customers.

This internship was very beneficial for me as my first professional experience. It allowed me to develop my relational skills both in contact with customers and with the team that always encouraged me.
