SafeWay is a GPS application that favors safety instead of speed for the
itineraries it offers and which also leans on its community to signal and
report suspicious or dangerous behaviors.

There are around a thousand assaults that occur every day in France. This
number continues to increase by more than 10% each year for assaults
on women of 18 to 30 years of age. At the same time, women’s speech
liberation movements appear on social networks, such as #metoo or
#balancetonporc. There are more women testifying regarding this
increase and their feelings of insecurity.

Insecurity is now seen as a societal issue. Some solutions have been
created to reassure the population but most of them are ineffective or
unsuitable. This is the reason why we feel it is important to work on this
primary need of addressing the problem of security in our streets.

Thanks to our application SafeWay, we wish to offer our users an answer
to this additional need linked to safety: freedom of movement. The
application offers our users a unique solution to reassure them in their
daily movement and that way increase their safety. Thanks to predefined
criteria (influx, luminosity, harassment and attack statistics, ...) the
application will propose different itineraries ranked depending on their
safety level. Other options will also enable you to follow a loved one’s
movements and be able to report suspicious behavior.
